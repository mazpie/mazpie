Hi, I am Pietro Mazzaglia and I am a PhD researcher in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Ghent, Belgium, supervised by Tim Verbelen and Bart Dhoedt. 

The objective of my research is to build intelligent agents that discover and learn how to behave in the environment by interacting with it.
